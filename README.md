# Privacy Policy

This is the legally required Privacy Policy for Clark International Speedway Weather Facebook page.

It is _very_ simple.

We use Facebook to display recent weather images of the sky above Clark International Speedway in the Philippines.

Many riders and drivers travel long distances to get to the track, and it would be nice to know before leaving home if the weather is unsuitable for a track day.

Regarding Privacy:

- We do not track who looks at this page or the weather.
- We do not ask Facebook for ANY user details.
- We post photos automatically from my balcony. That's all this page does. We do not want your private information.
- We might occassionally look at the Facebook analytics to see if anyone ever uses the page.
- We will not market, advertise, or contact people who look at this page.
- We may respond in the regular Facebook manner, to anyone who posts to this page.
- We do not guarantee to keep this page running correctly, accurate, or up to date.
- We do not commit to respond to posts or messages related to the page.


- If I feel like having the track to myself I might post pictures of a thunderstorm (Just Joking).


If you find the site useful, say hi to Philip Callender (Ducati Panigale #61) at the track.
